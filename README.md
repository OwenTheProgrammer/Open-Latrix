# Open-Latrix

This project is an open source version of my math heavy [Latrix Laser System](https://owentheprogrammer.gumroad.com/l/LatrixLaserSystem) found on my Gumroad. I've commented pretty much every line of the shader in aims to balance giving to the community and ensuring my financial stability.

## Conditions and Licensing

I am the sole owner, creator, and copyright holder of Latrix ("Latrix" or "Latrix Laser System.") Latrix represents the software distributed in the form of a typical unitypackage and/or Unity project. The original version of Latrix will remain *closed source.*

I grant permission to use, distribute, modify, make derivative works, and publish projects using Open-Latrix. The only condition I ask of is to credit this github repository and/or my Gumroad page for Latrix (please and thank ya!)
Please place said credits where one can easily find it and within or around the space your experience inhabits. Credits must be free of obstruction, easily readible, and accessible to the general public without restriction.

The original distribution of Latrix can be purchased seperately and *can not be redistributed.* This version is a careful reimplementation of the concepts I've come up with regaurding efficient shader raymarching, spanning **two years** of research and development.

You may read, study, and learn from the shader code I've distributed here, or simply use this project as an evaluation regaurding Latrix itself.

All im asking is you don't go outta your way to screw me over legally and help fund my future projects please <3

I am always happy to see what people do with my work as it remains the main driving factor for me to keep going. If you create something cool or have an event going on, id love to see/hear about it!

## Where do I go?

I've tried to make using Latrix as simple as possible and Open-Latrix should hold no different. All you have to do is import the unitypackage given in the Releases page of this repo and refer to the OpenLatrix scene / the prefab given.

The input texture will be projected like you'd expect from a real projector. Play around with it!

For any questions whatever, you can join [my discord server](https://discord.gg/nfbSuYzXkk) (and @ me, I don't mind)
